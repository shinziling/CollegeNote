# Financing Activities 

These are activities where you raise capital for your business. Two types which are equity and liabilities 
- Equity are cash that does not need to be pay back. They generally come from shareholders who are investing in the company. 
- Liabilities are money (e.g. bank loans) that needs to be pay back, they come from creditors such as the bank. 

All these combined are your asset. Assets = Equity + Liabilities. 

> The equation above is always true and it corresponds to a company balance sheet. 

# Investing Activities 

Once you obtain your asset, you can began operation. Assets are part of the investing activities, it is how you spent your money for the future benefits of the company. 
- Assets are resources spent for the company future


## Operating Activities

Assets are used for promotion, production, and advertisement of the company products and services. You began selling your products and services. 
- Operating Activities are split into two categories: Input and Output
	- Input: These are your expenses such as salaries, materials, and logistics 
	- Output: These are your revenues gain from selling your products and services. 

Income = Revenues - Expenses 

> The above equation is also the net income

# Income 


After income is earned, there are two ways to use them: One is to pay dividends to the shareholders (optional) and the other is reinvested back into the company (income retained by the company). Both of which are part of the statement of shareholder equity.
