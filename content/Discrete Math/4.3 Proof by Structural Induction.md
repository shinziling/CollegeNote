This induction is apply to a set of elements that is "recursively defined". This means it is used for any structure that defines itself or based on elements of the same set. 
- Some examples of recursively defined set are: 
	- Linked-List
	- Tree
	- Formal Language
		- Formal language are languages that has precise rules for its semantic and syntax, in other words, it is the grammar of a defined language. In computer science it is used to define the semantic and syntax used for a programming language.


# Steps

In structural induction, the inductive hypothesis is never stated but it is used in constructor case. 
- An constructor case describe how a new element or "widget" (we like to call it) can be created from a collection of smaller elements or "widgets". 

There can be one or more constructor case(s) and you need to prove each one but first a recursive definition needs to be defined. 

**Defining Recursive Definition:**
1. **Base Case:** The base case is basically an element or "widget" that is not built from collection of smaller widget (Ex. a single node of a binary tree). 
2. **Constructor Case 1:** describe a way a new widget can be created from an collection of smaller widgets.
3. **Constructor Case 2:** describe another way a new widget can be created from an collection of smaller widgets.
4. ......
5.  **Constructor Case $n$:** describe yet another way a new widget can be created from an collection of smaller widgets.
6. This can be repeat $n$ times


### Actual Proof
Given a claim, prove the claim for the base case and each constructor case(s).

1. **Base Case:** Prove the claim for the base case
2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** never actually stated, however, it is used in the inductive step. Basically, you assume the claim is true for each constructor case and using your assumption to help prove the each constructor case.
3. **Inductive Step:**
	1. Prove the claim for constructor case 1
	2. Prove the claim for constructor case 2
	3. ......
	4. Prove the claim for constructor case $n$
