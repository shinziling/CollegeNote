# Proof Example: 

#### 1. Claim: For any real number $x$: If $x$ is not an integer then $\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor -x \rfloor = -1$

>[!success]- Proof: 
>Let $x \in \Bbb R$, selected arbitrarily<br>
>Assume $x$ is not an integer, it suffices to show $\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor -x \rfloor = -1$
>1. Since $x$ is not an integer, $x$ cannot equal to its floor so $\lfloor x \rfloor < x < \lfloor x \rfloor + 1$
>4. Multiply the inequality by -1 yields 
>5. $- \lfloor x \rfloor > -x > - \lfloor x \rfloor - 1$
>7. Observe that $-x$ is not an integer since $x$ is not an integer therefore by the definition of floor
>8. $\lfloor -x \rfloor = - \lfloor x \rfloor - 1$ (remember the floor means round down)
>9. $\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor -x \rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor + ( - \lfloor x \rfloor - 1) = -1$, as desired $\blacksquare$
