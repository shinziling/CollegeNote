This is introductory course that talks about the basics of discrete math. 
It is similar to an introductory math proof course but is specifically tailored towards Computer Science students. 

### What is Discrete Structure? 
- By definition, a discrete structure is used to describe a set of elements with gaps in between each elements, it is the opposite to a continuous structure.
	- This is a particularly an important concept when it comes data structure in Computer Science since all data structure are discrete. 
>[!example|purple]- Examples of Discrete Structure
>- Integers$(\Bbb{Z})$
>- Natural Numbers$(\Bbb{N})$, 0 will be counted as a natural number

>[!example|purple.red]- Examples of Continuous Structure
>- Real Numbers$(\Bbb{R})$
>- Rational Numbers$(\Bbb{Q})$
