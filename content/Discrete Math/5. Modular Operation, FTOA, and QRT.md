# Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTOA)

>Also known as the "Unique Prime Factorization Theorem"

>[!info] The Theorem: 
>- For any $n > 1$, where $n \in \Bbb {N}^{>1}$, $n$ can be expressed as the product of primes (Existence) and there is only one way to express $n$ as product of primes (Uniqueness). 

So for example, 
$n = 2^{e_1} * 3^{e_2} * 5^{e_3} * ... * P_k^{e_k}$ (Some of the exponents may be 0)


# Modular Operation 

In number theory, $a \mod n$ gives the remainder when $a$ is divided by $n$. The result is always between $0$ to $n-1$ (Inclusive). 

>Note: The result is never negative unless the divisor which is $n$ is negative but this is not important to us.

Example: 
- $16 \mod 4 = 0$
- $7 \mod 7 = 0$
- $18 \mod 5 = 3$ 
- $-17 \mod 5 = 3$ why?
	- When doing modular operation you really are just subtracting or adding by the divisor each time until the dividend is a positive number but smaller than the divisor. 
		- So, take $-17 \mod 5 = 3$ as an example. 
			- add by 5, $-17, -12, -7, -2, 3$ 
			- Or, $5 * 4 = 20, -17 +20 = 3$


## Modular Congruence
This has some weird notation used but you may see something like this: 
- $a = b$ $(\mod n)$
	- This really just mean $a \mod n = b \mod n$ 
	- A better notation we use is $a \equiv_n b$

What the notation means is "$a$ is congruent to $b \mod n$"
- This means that if you take two numbers $a, b$ and did $a \mod n$ and $b \mod n$ then their result is the same. Therefore, $a$ is congruent to $b \mod n$. 

Examples: 
- $17$ is congruent to $1 \mod 4$ $(17 \equiv_4 1)$
	- $17 \mod 4 = 1$ and $1 \mod 4 = 1$, therefore 17 is congruent to 1 mod 4.
- $20$ is congruent to $10 \mod 5$ $(20 \equiv_5 10)$
	- $20 \mod 5 = 0$ and $10 \mod 5 = 0$, therefore 20 is congruent to 10 mod 5.
- Is $21$ congruent to $10 \mod 2$? $(21 \equiv_2 10)?$
	- No, $21 \mod 2 = 1$ and $10 \mod 2 = 0$, therefore 21 is not congruent to 10 mod 2. 

# Equivalence Theorem 
The followings are equivalent to each other (They all imply each other). For all $(a, b \in \Bbb {N})$
1. $a \equiv_n b$
2. $n|(a-b)$
3. $(\exists k \in \Bbb {Z})[a = b + kn]$

> See [[Fun Proof]] to see their equivalence.

# Modular Arithmetic Theorem (MAT)

Let $a, b, c, d, n \in \Bbb Z$ and $n > 1$. Suppose $a \equiv_n b$ and $c \equiv_n d$. Then the following are true:
1. $(a + b) \equiv_n (b + d)$
2. $(a - b) \equiv_n (b - d)$
3. $ab \equiv_n bd$
4. $a^m \equiv_n c^m$ for all natural number $m$

>Note: The four above are NOT equivalent to each other. Also, see [[Fun Proof]] on why they are true. 

Oftentimes, we use MAT to prove congruence in modular operation when dealing with large numbers.

>1. What is $12^6 \mod 5$? 
>		1. Well we know that $12 \mod 5 = 2$ which means $(12 \equiv_5 2)$. 
>		2. By number 4 on MAT, we can say $12^6 \equiv_5 2^6 = 64 \equiv_5 4$, therefore $12^6 \mod 5 = 4$
>			1. Note the difference between $\equiv_5$ and $=$. The above is saying that $2^6 = 64$ and 64 is congruent to 4 mod 5 (when in doubt just use $\equiv_5$, since saying $2^6 \equiv_5 64$ is still correct. Just don't saying something like $12^6 \equiv_5 2^6 = 64 = 4$, that is not correct, 64 is not equal to 4).

>		2. By number 4 on MAT, we can say $10^{12} \equiv_9 1^{12} = 1$ (Again you can say $1^{12} \equiv_9 1$ and that will still be correct), $10^{12} \mod 9 = 1$

>		3. By MAT, we can say $25^{777} \equiv_{13} (-1)^{777} \equiv_{13} -1 \equiv_{13} 12$, therefore $25^{777} \mod 13 = 12$

# Quotient-Remainder Theorem (QRT)

This really just means "what is the remainder?". Nothing fancy

> Formal Definition (This is a mouthful) : $(\forall a \in \Bbb Z)(\forall n \in \Bbb Z^+)(\exists q,r \in \Bbb Z)[(a = qn + r) \wedge (0 \leq r < n)]$

Summarizing what is saying above (in layman's terms): Suppose there is a number $a$ and a positive integer $n$, where $n$ is the divisor. Therefore, $a$ is equal to some number $q$ times the divisor $n$ plus some remainder $r$ where $r$ is between 0 and $n-1$ (Inclusive).

>Very useful when proving "something about mod n" in exhaustive proof (Brute Force). See [[Fun Proof]] on some examples.


Example with QRT: 
- Let $a = 50$ and $n = 4$
	- $a = 12(n) + 2$, remainder $r$ is 2 and $q$ is 12.

>[!faq]- "Fun Question": is $23^{81} - 13$ divisible by 12?
>
>1. Note: $23 \equiv_{12} -1$ (Since 23 mod 12 = 11 and -1 mod 12 = 11)
>2. Also note: $13 \equiv_{12} 1$, not really needed just here to showcase MAT
>3. So by MAT, $23^{81} - 13 \equiv_{12} (-1)^{81} - 1 = 0$
>
>The remainder is 0 so yes it is divisible by 12.
