A predicate is an expression that is either `true` or `false`. This depends on the value that is substituted for the variable. When defining a predicate the domain must also be specified. 
- A predicate is not a statement. But we can transform predicate into quantified statement. But for now this is an predicate: 
	- $P(x)$ = "x is odd", where x is an integer ($\Bbb{Z}$)
> Observe that we defined the predicate and the domain of x.

The domain of the variable does not have to just numbers and we can also have multiple variable in a domain.

>
>- $P(x,y) =$ "x > y", where $x, y \in \Bbb {R}$
>- $R(a, b) =$ "Student A is taller than Student B", where $a, b$ are students in your school

Logic connectivity can be used to connect different predicates together

>- $P(x) = \neg R(x) \wedge Q(x, y)$
>- $T(x, y) = \neg R(x) \to L(y)$
