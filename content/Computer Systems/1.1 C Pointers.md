Unlike Java where primitive data types do not have memory addresses associated with them, C does; this allows C to directly make use of their memory address.
- Pointers are denoted with an asterisk `*` before the variable name so like `int *a`
- They can hold the memory address of another variable with same data type. They cannot however store a value of their data type but we can dereference the memory address they hold to get the content of that memory address. 
- To deference a pointer use asterisk before the variable name so `*a`
- To get the memory address of another variable use the ampersand symbol before the name of the variable so `&a`. 
- A pointer variable also has a unique address associated with it.

Code ex: 

```c
#include <stdio.h> 

int main(){ 

int a = 10;

int *b = &a; // this is a pointer that is pointing to the memory address of a

int *c = b; // this is another pointer that copy the memory address that is stored in pointer b

int d = *b; // *b dereference b, tells d to copy the content of the address stored at b

printf("%d\n", *b); // deference b, and prints the content of the address stored in b

printf("%d\n", *c); // deference c, and prints the content of the address stored in b

return 0;
}
```
Output:
```bash
10
10
```

When a pointer is pointing to an address we can directly change the value contains within the address, this will also change the value of the variable in which the address was assigned to. 
- To change the value of the address that the pointer is pointing to we use deference

```c
#include <stdio.h> 

int main(){ 

int a = 10;

int *b = &a; // stores memory address of a in pointer b

int c = 9;

*b = 5; // dereference b, then set the val to 5. int a will also have the value of 5.

b = &c; // store the memory address of c in pointer b 


printf("%d, %d\n", a, *b); // print the value of variable a which is now 5

return 0;
}
```
Output:
```bash
5, 9
```
> The line `*b = 5` deference `b` and tells b to change the content of whatever address `b` contains to 5. This will also change the content of `a` since `a` is associated with that address. To change the memory address that is stored in `b` do not use the asterisk.


Pointers chaining are also possible in C where a pointer can store the memory address of another pointer. Just put another asterisk.

Code ex:
```c
#include <stdio.h> 

int main(){ 

int a = 10;

int *b = &a; // stores memory address of a in pointer b

int **c; // a pointer that stores the address of another pointer

**c = &b; // store the address of pointer b in c

// To deref c use **c (this is really deref deref c)
// we are derefing c twice. 

/* prints the content of the address stored in c which is the 
address of b then deref b and prints the content of the address stored
in b.
*/
printf("%d\n", **c); // prints 10


// We can chain this more

int ***d = &c; // stores address of c
int ****e = &d; // stores adddress of d

printf("%d\n", ***d); // deref d, prints 10
printf("%d\n", ****e); // deref e, prints 10

return 0;
}

```
Output:
```bash
10
10
10
```
> This can get really messy real quick.
