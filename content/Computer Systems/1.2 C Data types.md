Data types in C is separated into three categories: Integral, floating, and pointer


| Bytes | Integral Types | Range                    |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1     | char           | -128 to 127              |
| 2     | short          | -32768 to 32767          |
| 4     | int            | $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31} -1$ |
| 8     | long           | $-2^{63}$ to $2^{63} -1$ |

| Bytes | Floating types | Range        |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------ |
| 4     | float          | $\pm 2^{31}$ |
| 8     | double         | $\pm 2^{63}$ |


| Bytes | Pointer type | Range                                                           |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4/8   | pointer      | can be either 32 bits or 64 bits depending on the system<br>    |
|       | array        | points to a fixed location such as `int [] or double [][]` etc. |

> Integral types has 1 extra number in its negative range than positive; this has to do with something called the Two's Complement representation. Meanwhile, floating types are symmetrical across its negative and positive range.

>Number of bytes for each type is NOT standard by C but are the most common ones.


## Missing Types

- Booleans are not used in C. Any piece of data in C is either true or false. Typically, 0 is the only thing that is false. With that being said any data that has a 1 in it is true. So, 001000 is true else if it is all 0's then it is false. 
- String. There is no dedicated type for string in C. Strings are just an array of characters in C. Languages like Java has a dedicated String class that has some useful implementations such as `substring()` and `indexOf()`.



# Void Pointers

Denoted as `void *pointer`, these are pointers that can point to any data type. 
- They can store any memory address but have no ways of retrieving their content (dereferencing) without tricking the compiler to do so.
- They are useful in storing arbitrary memory address
- To dereference, you would do a typecast.

Code ex 1:
```c
#include <stdio.h> 

int main(){ 

int a = 10;
void *p = &a; // void pointer points to int a address

int b = *((int *) p); // typecast to trick the compiler into dereferencing
printf("%d\n", b); 

return 0;
}
```

Output:
```bash
10
```

> `(*(int *) p)` typecast the void pointer p to a integer pointer then we dereference p after it been casted to a integer pointer. 


Code ex 2:
```c
#include <stdio.h> 

int main(){ 

double a = 3.145; 
void *p = &a; 

int b = *((int *) p); 
printf("%d", b); 
}
```

Output: 
```bash
309237645
```

> So what happened? Void pointer removes the compiler ability to type check, so the compiler doesn't check the cast when casting a double into a integer since `p` is a void pointer.  Double is 8 bytes and integer is 4 bytes so the compiler will instead interpret half of the double as integer.

>[!note]
>If pointer `p` was `int *p` instead then the compiler will do a type check. Integer pointer can only point at integer and nothing else. 


# More Types


## Unsigned Type

There are unsigned type for integral type so we have
```c
unsigned char; // 0 to 255
unsigned short; // 0 to (2^16 - 1)
unsigned int; // 0 to (2^32 - 1) 
unsigned long; // 0 to (2^64 - 1)
```

> The types above turn all the negative value into positive thus expanding the positive range.


## Fixed width

We can also restrict the bit an integer type can hold

```c
int8_t; // 8 bits int
int16_t;
int32_t;
int64_t;
```


> There are more types but we will stop here. 


# Array

Array in C is a continuous block of homogenous data. 
- Array are denoted with `[]` such as `int a[]`
- To access an element of an array we can use the indexing feature so like `a[2`]. This access the third element in the array, the first element is at index 0. 
- Array must first be initialize with a certain amount of space. 

Code ex: 
```c 
#include <stdio.h> 

int main(){ 

int a[5]; // tells the compiler to allocated 5 memory cells 
int b[] = {1, 2, 4}; // allocated 3 memory cells the compiler also initialize the element
int c[2] = {3, 4}; // allocated 2 memory and initialize the element
int d[]; // this is an error
}
```

> The `int c[2]` must have 2 elements since that is what it is being declared or else it will have cause an error. The `int b[]` does not have a specified amount but element(s) needs to be initialized to prevent an error as it happened with `int d[]`. `int a[5]` just tells the compiler to allocated 5 memory cells but no value has been initialized.

>[!important]
>The size of the array cannot be change once it is declared. Since the compiler cannot just reallocated more cells. There is also no out of bounds check for array, this mean you can go beyond the boundary of an array until you reach beyond the amount of memory the compiler allocated for the program which will cause a segmentation error. 


## Array and Pointer

Array and pointer works similarly but has some differences in the way how they work.
- Array has a fixed memory location while pointer can be anywhere. 
- Pointer can reference any location while the location reference an array cannot be changed.
- Pointer can be treated as an array with 1 element indexed at 0. This mean you can dereference the pointer by doing `a[0]` instead of `*a`.
- Pointer can point to an array, this would points to the first element in the array. 

```c 
#include <stdio.h> 

int main(){ 
int a[] = {1, 2, 5, 7};

int *p = a; // points to the first element in the array


// all three print statement does the same thing
printf("%d\n", *p);
printf("%d\n", a[0]);
printf("%d\n", p[0]);

// we can also treat p as an array with the elements listed
printf("%d\n", p[1]) // prints the second element

int m = 8;
int *z = &m // new pointer point to int m in memory

printf("%d\n", z[0]); // using z[0] instead of *z
}
```

Output: 
```bash 
1
1
1
2
8
```


## Pointer Arithmetic

- Adding one to a pointer will just move the pointer to point to its next memory cell.
	- If it an integer pointer it will add 4 bytes since integer are 4 bytes. This means memory cell for integer are 4 bytes apart.

Code ex:
```c
#include <stdio.h> 
int main(){ 
int a[] = {1, 2, 5, 7};

int *p = a; // points to the first element in the array

printf("%d\n", *p); 

p = a + 1; // pointer arithmetic move to the next element in the array

printf("%d\n", *p); 

p++; // does the same thing as p = a + 1 or p = p + 1

printf("%d\n", *p);

p+= 2; // move the pointer ahead two, this goes beyond the array boundary

printf("%d\n", *p);
}

```


Output: 
```bash 
1
2
5
# ans vary, a number or an segmentation error might appear
```



## Function Argument

Pointer and array are interchangeable when passing in an argument into a function. 
- If a function takes in a pointer variable as a argument, an array can be passed into the function instead. 
- Similarly, if a function takes in an array as a argument, an pointer can be passed into the function instead. 


Code ex: 
```c
#include <stdio.h> 

int foo(int *a){ 

// code not shown
}

int bar(int a[]){ 

// code not shown
}

int main(){ 
int a[] = {1, 2, 5, 7};
foo(a); // passed in an array as an argument instead of a pointer

int z = 10; 
int *p = &z; 

bar(p); // passed in a pointer as an argument instead of an array
}
```
